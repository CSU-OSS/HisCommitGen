## HisCommitGen

For VSCode, you can search "HisCommitGen" on the extension market to install it. Since the limit of the cloud server, we only deployed a version that uses our private DeepSeek API. So the API usage is limited, and this version can only be used to experience the function of HisCommitGen (The response time of DeepSeek API is long, so be patient waitting for the generated results **:sweat_smile:**). In the future, we will remove the "HisCommitGen-Server" and let the user fill their own API keys on the local machine.

**:bowtie:Due to the plugin audit mechanism of JetBrains, we didn't publish HisCommitGen to JetBrains' Market. You can download the project and run it on local machine.**


### installation:  
1. Open your VSCode IDE  
2. Navigate to Extensions ‚Üí Marketplace.  
3. Search for "HisCommitGen" and click Install.

### Configure Settings:  
Go to Settings‚Üí Tools ‚Üí CMG plunging settings.  
Adjust the following parameters:  
+ Use History Commit Messages: Toggle to enable/disable historical commit context.  
+ Generate more recommendation messagesÔºö5 by default, you can increase the number after this function is enabled.  
+ temperature: Controls randomness (0.0‚Äì1.0; lower values = more deterministic).  
+ maxTokens: Maximum length of generated messages.
 
### Usage  
HisCommitGen supports two workflows: Recommendation (full message generation) and Completion (prefix-based suggestions).
1. Commit Message Recommendation  
  Scenario: Generate commit messages from scratch after code changes.  
  A list of 5 recommended messages will appear. Use the arrow keys to navigate and press Enter to apply.  
2. Commit Message Completion  
  Scenario: Auto-complete a message based on a partial prefix.


### Scoring criterion for hunman evaluation

| Score | Definition                                                              |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | Neither relevant in semantic nor having shared tokens.                 |
| 1     | Irrelevant in semantic but with some shared tokens.                    |
| 2     | Partially similar in semantic, but each contains exclusive information.|
| 3     | Relevant in semantic.                                                  |
| 4     | Highly similar but not identical in semantic.                          |
| 5     | Identical in semantic.                                                 |


### Efficacy of different history retrieval methods for *HisCommitGen*

Table 2 below presents the results of using different retrieval methods for *HisCommitGen*.

* **No retrieval** refers to not providing any commit history.
* **Random retrieval** involves randomly selecting a message from the developer's commit history.

The results show:

* Using no retrieval produces the lowest scores.
* Random retrieval slightly improves performance.
* **TF-IDF** and **BM25** are sparse retrieval methods.
* **CodeT5 embedding** is a dense retriever using cosine similarity on embedded vectors of code changes.
* All retrieval methods (TF-IDF, BM25, and CodeT5 embedding) significantly enhance performance, yielding similar scores.
* **BM25** achieves the highest scores across multiple metrics, showing its superiority.

#### Table 2: Efficacy of different history retrieval methods for *HisCommitGen*

| Retrieval Method | BLEU (%) | METEOR (%) | Log-MNEXT (%) |
| ---------------- | -------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| No retrieval     | 1.63     | 13.42      | 12.51         |
| Random           | 2.13     | 15.44      | 12.69         |
| TF-IDF           | 3.36     | 19.24      | 15.58         |
| CodeT5 embedding | 3.40     | 19.40      | 15.65         |
| **BM25**         | **3.42** | **19.60**  | **15.81**     |
